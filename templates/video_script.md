# Video Script Template for Trilium Scripts

This template provides a structured approach for creating engaging video content about your Trilium scripts.

## Video Information

- **Video Title**: {Catchy title that solves a specific problem}
- **Script Reference**: {Link to the specific script}
- **Target Audience**: {Who is this video for?}
- **Video Length**: {Target duration}
- **Difficulty Level**: {Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced}
- **Prerequisites**: {What viewers should know before watching}

## Video Structure

### 1. Introduction (0:00 - 0:30)

**Hook** (0:00-0:10):
- Start with a relatable problem or pain point
- Show the "before" scenario
- Ask a question to engage viewers

**Overview** (0:10-0:30):
- Briefly introduce the solution
- What viewers will learn
- Why this matters to them

**Example Hook:**
> "Are you tired of manually searching through hundreds of notes in Trilium to find specific information? What if you could automatically organize and visualize all your note attributes in seconds? Today, I'll show you how to do exactly that with the Promoted Attributes Table script."

### 2. Problem & Solution (0:30 - 1:30)

**Problem Statement** (0:30-1:00):
- Describe the specific challenge
- Explain why existing solutions are inadequate
- Show real-world impact

**Solution Overview** (1:00-1:30):
- Introduce your script as the solution
- Brief explanation of how it works
- Key benefits and features

**Example:**
> "The problem is that Trilium's built-in attribute management is basic. You can't see all your promoted attributes at once, making it hard to understand your data structure. The Promoted Attributes Table script solves this by scanning your entire database and creating beautiful, organized tables of all your attributes."

### 3. Installation & Setup (1:30 - 4:00)

**Requirements** (1:30-2:00):
- Trilium version requirements
- Any prerequisites
- System requirements

**Step-by-Step Installation** (2:00-3:30):
- Create the note
- Copy/paste the script
- Configure note type
- Initial setup

**Basic Configuration** (3:30-4:00):
- Essential settings to configure
- Quick test run
- Verify installation

**Screen Flow:**
1. Show Trilium interface
2. Create new note
3. Paste script code
4. Configure as JavaScript Backend
5. Show browser console execution

### 4. Live Demo (4:00 - 8:00)

**Basic Demo** (4:00-5:30):
- Run the script with default settings
- Show the output/results
- Explain what's happening

**Configuration Demo** (5:30-7:00):
- Change key settings
- Show how output changes
- Demonstrate flexibility

**Advanced Features** (7:00-8:00):
- Show more complex usage
- Demonstrate edge cases
- Performance demonstration

**Demo Script:**
> "Let me run the script now... You can see it's finding all the promoted attributes in my database. Look at that - it's creating a comprehensive table with 45 attribute definitions across 234 notes. Now let me change the configuration to show only frequently used attributes..."

### 5. Use Cases (8:00 - 10:00)

**Scenario 1: Knowledge Management** (8:00-8:30):
- Specific problem solved
- How the script helps
- Expected results

**Scenario 2: Project Organization** (8:30-9:00):
- Different application
- Custom configuration
- Benefits shown

**Scenario 3: Team Collaboration** (9:00-10:00):
- Shared environment usage
- Team benefits
- Integration with workflows

**Example Use Case:**
> "For knowledge management, you can use this to track all your tags and categories, making it easy to see how your knowledge is organized. For project management, you can track project-specific attributes and see the status across all related notes."

### 6. Troubleshooting & Tips (10:00 - 11:30)

**Common Issues** (10:00-10:45):
- Performance problems
- Configuration errors
- Permission issues
