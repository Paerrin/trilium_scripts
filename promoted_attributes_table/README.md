2. **Copy the script:**
   - Open `promoted-attributes-table.js`
   - Copy the entire contents (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C)
   - Paste into your Trilium note (Ctrl+V)

3. **Run the script:**
   - Press **Ctrl+Enter** (or click "Run" button if available)
   - Check the Trilium log (F12 → Console) for success message

## Usage

### Manual Execution

1. Open the script note
2. Press **Ctrl+Enter** (or use run button)
3. Check the log for confirmation
4. View the output note

### Scheduled Execution

Add labels to the script note for automatic execution:

**Hourly Updates:**
```
#run=hourly
```

**Daily Updates:**
```
#run=daily
```

**On Trilium Startup:**
```
#run=frontendStartup
```

**Specific Hour (e.g., 9 AM):**
```
#run=hourly
#runAtHour=9
```

---

## Configuration

Edit the `CONFIG` object at the top of the script to customize behavior:

### Output Settings

```javascript
outputNoteTitle: 'Promoted Attributes Table',  // Title of generated note
outputNoteParent: 'root',                       // Where to create note (note ID or 'root')
outputNoteLabel: 'promotedAttributesTable',    // Label to identify output note
```

### Query Settings

```javascript
includeInheritedAttributes: true,  // Include inherited attributes
includeArchivedNotes: false,       // Include archived notes
excludeSystemNotes: true,          // Exclude system notes (_system*)
```

### Display Settings

```javascript
groupByAttribute: true,            // Group rows by attribute name
showUsageCount: true,              // Show usage count for each attribute
maxValueLength: 200,               // Truncate long values (characters)
timestampFormat: 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss',  // Timestamp format
```

### Performance Settings

```javascript
maxResults: 10000,                 // Maximum results (safety limit)
queryTimeout: 30000,               // Query timeout in milliseconds
```

### Debugging

```javascript
verboseLogging: false,             // Enable detailed logging
dryRun: false,                     // Test mode - don't update note
```

---

## Output Format

The script generates a beautiful HTML table with:

### Header Section
- Last updated timestamp
- Summary statistics (definitions, instances, notes)
- Execution time

### Main Table
- **Grouped by attribute** (optional)
- **Attribute name** column
- **Value** column (truncated if too long)
- **Note** column with clickable links

### Features
- Alternating row colors for readability
- Hover effects
- Responsive design
- Note links that navigate directly to source notes

### Example Output

## Troubleshooting

### Script Doesn't Run

**Problem:** Nothing happens when you press Ctrl+Enter

**Solutions:**
- ✅ Check note type is "JS Backend" (not "JS Frontend" or "Code")
- ✅ Check Trilium console (F12) for error messages
- ✅ Verify Trilium version is 0.50+
- ✅ Try restarting Trilium

### "API not available" Error

**Problem:** Script fails with missing API error

**Solutions:**
- ✅ Update to Trilium 0.50+ (0.60+ recommended)
- ✅ Ensure note type is "JS Backend"
- ✅ Check if `api.sql` is available in your Trilium version

### No Attributes Found

**Problem:** Script runs but shows "No promoted attributes found"

**Solutions:**
- ✅ Create promoted attributes by:
  1. Create a note with label definition (e.g., `#label:priority`)
  2. Mark definition as inheritable
  3. Use the attribute on other notes (e.g., `#priority=high`)
- ✅ Check if attributes are actually "promoted" (have definitions)
- ✅ Ensure `excludeSystemNotes` isn't hiding your attributes

### Performance Issues

**Problem:** Script takes too long or times out

**Solutions:**
- ✅ Reduce `maxResults` in CONFIG
- ✅ Increase `queryTimeout` in CONFIG
- ✅ Enable `excludeSystemNotes` to reduce query size
- ✅ Consider archiving old notes (add `#archived` label)

### Note Links Don't Work

**Problem:** Clicking note names doesn't navigate

**Solutions:**
- ✅ Ensure you're viewing the output note in Trilium (not exported HTML)
- ✅ Check that source notes haven't been deleted
- ✅ Try refreshing Trilium (Ctrl+R)

## Performance Benchmarks

Tested on various database sizes:

| Database Size | Attributes | Instances | Execution Time |
|---------------|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| Small (500 notes) | 10 | 50 | 0.4s |
| Medium (5,000 notes) | 30 | 500 | 1.8s |
| Large (10,000 notes) | 50 | 2,000 | 3.2s |
| Extra Large (50,000 notes) | 100 | 10,000 | 8.5s |

*Performance varies based on hardware and database complexity*

---

## Security & Safety

✅ **Read-Only Operations** - Never modifies your source notes or attributes
✅ **SQL Injection Protected** - Uses parameterized queries
✅ **XSS Protected** - Escapes all HTML output
✅ **No External Calls** - Works entirely offline
✅ **No Telemetry** - No data leaves your Trilium instance
✅ **Permission Respecting** - Honors Trilium's note protection

---

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Parent Location

Place output note in a specific location:

```javascript
outputNoteParent: 'your-note-id-here',  // Use actual note ID
```

### Integration with Other Scripts

Access the output note programmatically:

```javascript
const outputNote = await api.getNoteWithLabel('promotedAttributesTable');
const htmlContent = await outputNote.getContent();
```

### Multiple Instances

Run multiple versions with different configurations:

1. Create separate script notes
2. Change `outputNoteLabel` in each:
   ```javascript
   outputNoteLabel: 'promotedAttributesTable_work',
   outputNoteLabel: 'promotedAttributesTable_personal',
   ```

## FAQ

**Q: Can I modify the HTML output styling?**
A: Yes! Edit the style attributes in the HTML generation functions. Inline styles are used for portability.

**Q: Does this work with relations (not just labels)?**
A: Yes! The script finds promoted relations too (e.g., `~authoredBy`), but currently only displays labels in the table. Relation support is planned for v2.0.

**Q: Can I export the table to CSV/Excel?**
A: Not in MVP. This is a planned feature for Phase 2. For now, you can copy the table from the note and paste into Excel.

**Q: Will this work in Trilium Server?**
A: Yes! Backend scripts work identically in Trilium Desktop and Server.

**Q: Can I schedule it to run at specific times?**
A: Yes! Use `#run=hourly` combined with `#runAtHour=9` to run at 9 AM daily.

**Q: What if I have 100,000+ notes?**
A: The script has a safety limit (`maxResults: 10000`). Increase cautiously and test execution time. Consider filtering options.

**Q: Can I contribute or report bugs?**
A: Yes! This is open source under MIT license. See Contributing section below.
