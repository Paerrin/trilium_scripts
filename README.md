# trilium_scripts

This is my collection of scripts and things for Trilium. These are AI coded as I am not a dev. I wanted to use the free model offerings for good and publish some new content for Trilium. It's a great program, especially for self-hosters, so this is my way of giving back. I hope you find some of these useful.
